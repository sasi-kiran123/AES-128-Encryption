# AES-128-Encryption

AES encryption is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is one of the most widely used and secure encryption standards in the world. AES encryption operates on blocks of 128 bits, and can use keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The number of rounds of encryption depends on the key size, and ranges from 10 to 14. Each round consists of four steps: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. The last step involves adding a round key that is derived from the original key using a key schedule algorithm. AES encryption is based on the substitution-permutation network principle, which means that it transforms the input data by applying a series of substitutions and permutations. AES encryption is very efficient and fast in both hardware and software implementations


AES encryption is best for securing data at rest and in transit because it is fast, efficient, and secure. AES encryption has the following advantages:

It is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. This makes it faster and simpler than asymmetric encryption algorithms, which use different keys for encryption and decryption.
It has a variable key length, which means it can use keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The longer the key, the more secure the encryption. AES encryption with a 256-bit key is considered to be practically unbreakable by modern computers.
It encrypts data in 128-bit blocks, which means it can handle large amounts of data efficiently. It also operates on bytes rather than bits, which makes it faster and easier to implement in hardware and software.
It uses a substitution-permutation network principle, which means it transforms the input data by applying a series of substitutions and permutations. This makes it resistant to various types of attacks, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis.
It is an open standard that is free to use for any public, private, commercial, or non-commercial purpose. It is also certified by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and used by the US government and many other organizations around the world.
